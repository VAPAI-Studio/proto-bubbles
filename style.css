       User said "full screen but 9:16". 
       Interpretation: The content should be 9:16, maybe centered on black/red background?
       Or just full screen on a phone. 
       Let's make the canvas fill the screen but we'll handle the "9:16" logic in Three.js or just let it be responsive.
       Actually, "full screen but 9:16" usually implies a mobile-first vertical layout. 
       I will make the canvas fill the window. */
